## Rainbow Page

[Demo site](http://color.benwlynch.com/)

A small mini-project to practice basic html, css, and js without using a framework like React. The project is a single html page template for a webpage that cycles through a rainbow of colors as the background. The text cycles through the same color cycle exactly opposite of the background to continually make them complimentary colors that contrast each other (or this can be commented out to leave it as black). Uncommenting several lines in the javascript portion provides text that tracks the current color values and what stage in the cycle the colors are at. Note that you can increase or decrease the variable 'rate' to inversally slow down or speed up the rate at which the colors cycle. See the comments in the file for more information on how the cycle works.
